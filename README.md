*Girl Life is an 18+ game; this mod and repository are intended for adult audiences.*

GLQS Stable is a quick-setup cheat mod for **Girl Life**. Once installed, it adds a
single in-game link that opens a menu for instantly maxing out money,
consumables, stats, skills, school grades, relationships, health/energy, fame
and reputation, unlocking all clothing and body mods, and toggling a long list
of quality-of-life cheats - no save editing or outside tools required.

This guide covers everything a player needs: getting the mod, installing it,
and turning it on in-game. (Developers who want to build GLQS Stable from
source instead of downloading it should see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) - not
needed for normal play.)

## 1. How to Get the Mod

> **Before you download:** GLQS Stable is a mod for **Girl Life - English
> Community Version (ECV)**. Make sure Girl Life (ECV) is already installed
> and working on its own first - GLQS Stable has nothing to load into by
> itself and cannot be played individually.

GLQS Stable is distributed as a single, ready-to-use file, `GLQS.qsp`:

1. Go to the **[GLQS Stable Releases page](https://github.com/xBandaku/GLQS-Stable/releases/latest)**.
2. The release at the top is always the newest version.
3. Under **Assets**, download **`GLQS.qsp`**.
   - The page will also list "Source code (zip)" and "Source code (tar.gz)" -
     ignore those. They're just a snapshot of the raw project source for
     developers and won't work as a mod on their own. You only need
     `GLQS.qsp`.
4. Save it somewhere you'll remember (e.g. your Downloads folder) - you'll
   move it in the next step.

There's nothing to unzip, install, or run - `GLQS.qsp` is the finished mod
file itself.

*Prefer to build it yourself from source instead? See the Build section in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).*

## 2. How to Install the Mod

1. Find the folder where **Girl Life** itself is installed.
2. Inside that folder, look for a subfolder named exactly `mod` (all
   lowercase, no "s"). If it doesn't exist yet, create it.
3. Move or copy the `GLQS.qsp` file you downloaded into that `mod` folder.
4. Don't rename the file - it must stay exactly `GLQS.qsp`.

You should now have a file at `<your Girl Life folder>/mod/GLQS.qsp`. That's
the entire install - the next section switches it on inside the game.

## 3. How to Enable the Mod In-Game

Putting the file in the `mod` folder makes it available, but Girl Life won't
actually use it until you register it once from inside the game:

1. Open Girl Life and get to the **Mods** screen, either:
   - from the very first title screen (before loading or starting a save),
     click **Manage mods**; or
   - from inside an existing save, open your in-game phone, tap the
     gear/Settings icon, then open the **Mods** tab.
2. Click **Install new mod**.
3. A text box asks you to type a mod name. Type `GLQS` exactly - capital
   letters matter - and confirm.
   - The prompt mentions "the example image above" - that's generic wording
     the game shows for installing any mod, not something specific to GLQS.
     Just type `GLQS`.
4. GLQS now appears in your installed mods list and is active immediately -
   no restart needed.

> **About the version number shown:** the Mods list displays GLQS's version
> as **"0.34 fix 4"** rather than "0.34.4" - that's just the base game's own
> display format for mod version numbers (major.minor "fix" patch). It's the
> same version, not a mismatch.

> **Using an existing save?** Girl Life tracks installed mods per save file.
> If you have older saves from before you installed GLQS, load each one and
> repeat steps 1-3 once, then save again so it sticks.

### Using the mod

Once installed, a bold **MOD Quick Setup MOD** link automatically appears near
the top of nearly every screen in the game - click it to open GLQS's own
cheat menu. It's on by default, so there's nothing else to turn on.

The link intentionally does not appear:
- while your character is still being created,
- during the game's own scripted story or sex scenes, or
- on the wardrobe or clothing-store screens.

That's expected behavior, not a bug - it just keeps the link out of the way
at those moments.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

**I don't see the "Quick Setup" link anywhere.**
First check you're not in one of the three situations listed just above. If
it's still missing, open the game's own built-in cheat menu and look for a
**"Quick Setup Mod: Enabled/Disabled"** toggle - click it to turn the link
back on.

**I keep seeing a message like "WARNING: mod_GLQS is not found!", or the Quick
Setup link has disappeared after closing and reopening Girl Life.**
Go to phone Settings > **Mods** tab and click **Update all mods**. Confirm
the "are you sure" prompt by typing anything into it. This reloads every
installed mod's code for your current session and should bring GLQS back.

**I got a message like "GLQS.qsp is not a Girl life ECV mod, please contract
its author for help".**
(Yes, "contract" - that's the base game's own wording, not a typo introduced
here.) It means the game couldn't read `GLQS.qsp` as a valid mod. Re-download
the file in case it's corrupted or incomplete, confirm it's named exactly
`GLQS.qsp` inside your `mod` folder, and confirm you're running Girl Life -
English Community Version.

**I got an "ACCESS DENIED... cannot be played individually" message.**
That appears only if `GLQS.qsp` gets opened directly as if it were its own
game, instead of being installed as a mod through the Mods tab. Follow the
installation and enabling steps above instead.

**Where can I see what's new in the latest version?**
Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/xBandaku/GLQS-Stable/releases) on
GitHub for the full changelog, or, in-game, click the small info icon next to
GLQS's entry in your installed mods list.
